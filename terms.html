        <h1 class='title'>Terms and conditions</h1>
        <p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the “Knot
            Bot” Discord Bot (“Discord Bot” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively,
            “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and the Discord Bot
            developer (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business
            or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in
            which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority,
            or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not
            access and use the Discord Bot and Services. By accessing and using the Discord Bot and Services, you
            acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You
            acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and
            is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Discord Bot and Services.
        </p>
        <h2 class='subtitle'>Accounts and membership</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Discord Bot and Services. By using the Discord Bot and
            Services and by agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at least 13 years of age.
            We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated
            any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and
            goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services.
            You may not create, own or use more than one account to access your Services.
        </p>
        <h2 class='subtitle'>Links to other resources</h2>
        <p>Although the Discord Bot and Services may link to other resources (such as websites etc.), we are not,
            directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with
            any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating,
            and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their resources. We
            do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other
            third parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource
            which you access through a link in the Discord Bot. Your linking to any other off-site resources is at your
            own risk.
